                    Introducing *Habitats: City, Coast and Forest*, the latest addition to The Local Project's collection of timeless publications.<br /><br />
                    This trio of hardcover books features 600 pages of extraordinary homes from across Australia, New Zealand, North America, and Canada. The collection masterfully captures the work of industry-leading design practices such as Smart Design Studio, Wardle, James Stockwell, Olson Kundig, Fearon Hay, Aires Mateus, Rob Mills Architecture & Interiors, Faulkner Architects, and Atelier Lâ€™Abri.<br /><br />
                    Each volume is a testament to a deeply considered architectural expression that goes beyond mere shelter and includes 10 such examples that demonstrate a harmonious connection with its natural surroundings.
